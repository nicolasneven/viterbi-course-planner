Students learn about the process and methods underlying scientific inquiry, learn how to obtain accurate experimental results, are trained in the formulation of empirically-testable hypotheses, and then develop a basis for understanding the distinction between unsupported assertions versus conclusions based on sound scientific reasoning. As a result, all students should acquire substantive knowledge in science and technology, understand the processes by which scientists investigate and answer scientific questions, and be able to articulate the basic principles used to explain natural phenomena.",
